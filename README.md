## üìö What I Learned

### 1. **Working with Swiper.js**

- **Initialization**: Setting up multiple Swiper instances with different configurations.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling conflicts between overlapping styles and functionalities of two Swiper sliders.
- **Customization**: Implementing unique styles and features for each slider.

### 2. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**

- Inspecting layout issues with browser developer tools.
- Debugging conflicting styles and JavaScript interactions.
- Using `console.log` for dynamic width calculations to ensure layout consistency.

### 3. **Scoped Styling**

- Creating scoped CSS rules to ensure different components (sliders) don't interfere with each other.
- Understanding the importance of specific class names to isolate styles.

### 4. **Modular JavaScript**

- Writing independent scripts for specific features like sliders and modals.
- Organizing code into reusable components for maintainability.

## üåü Challenges Faced

1. **Swiper.js Conflicts**:

   - Overlapping class names caused unintended behaviors.
   - Solution: Scoped the classes for `.swiper-slide` to ensure styles and configurations didn't conflict.

2. **Responsive Design**:

   - Ensuring both sliders were responsive and looked good on all devices.
   - Solution: Used flexible widths (`max-width`, `overflow: hidden`) and tested on various screen sizes.

3. **Debugging Unexpected Layouts**:
   - Layouts not behaving as expected due to inherited styles.
   - Solution: Inspected computed styles using browser tools.
